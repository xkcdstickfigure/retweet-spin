# retweet-spin
I used OBS with a browser source to stream this page into a Periscope (RIP) stream, which was embedded in a tweet. Then the server would get the profile information of the last user to retweet that tweet and it would be displayed on the page. This made a lot of people retweet the tweet for some reason.
